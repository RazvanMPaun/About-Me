Cognitive Class Introductory Course

Look, mom! I'm writing code!

From literary critical analysis to learning how to code it's a long way, but here I am!

I am passionate about people and knowledge.

Rare Skill Alert: I can go throughout the day without a drop of coffee (yes, that's a thing, believe me). 

I'm a fintech and blockchain technology enthusiast with a keen interest in investment management. Could spend weeks in a row reading reports, articles and books on different subjects (anthropology currently lights my fire).

Eager to meet!

...and uh oh...learn to code.
